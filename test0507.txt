One of the important aspects of the defect life cycle on a generic level includes defect tracking.

In line with defect maintenance processes, when any tester files a defect-apart from the method/description to reproduce
the issue seen, he has to also furnish some categorical information which would aid in accurate classification of the
defect. This, in turn, would help in efficient defect tracking/maintenance processes and would also form the basis for
quicker defect turnaround time.
